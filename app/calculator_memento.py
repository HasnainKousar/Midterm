Calculator Memento

In this module, we define the `CalculatorMemento` class, which is used to store the state of the calculator.
This class is part of the memento design pattern, allowing us to store calculator states
for undo/redo functionality.

key features:
- Memento design pattern: Captures and stores the state of the calculator without exposing its internal structure.
- Serialization and deserialization: convert mementos to and from a dictionaries for prersistence.
