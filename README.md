## üöÄ Project Description
This enhanced calculator application provides a mathematical computation platform with an interactive command-line interface. Built using Python design patterns including the Factory Pattern, Observer Pattern, and Memento Pattern, it offers functionality for mathematical operations, history tracking, and session management with undo/redo capabilities.

### Key Architectural Features
- **REPL Interface**: Interactive command-line environment with colorized output
- **Design Patterns**: Implementation of Factory, Observer, and Memento patterns
- **History Management**: Persistent calculation history with CSV storage
- **Undo/Redo Functionality**: Complete operation state management
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-based configuration system
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 100% test coverage with pytest (90%+ required)
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing with GitHub Actions


## ‚ú® Features

## Mathematical Operations
- **Basic Arithmetic**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- **Advanced Operations**: Power, Root, Modulus, Integer Division, Percentage, Absolute Difference

### User Interface Features
- **Colorized Output**: Green for normal operations, red for errors
- **Interactive REPL**: Command-line interface with real-time feedback
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and recovery

### Data Management
- **Persistent History**: CSV-based calculation storage
- **Session Management**: Load and save calculation 
- **Undo/Redo**: Operation state management
- **Auto-save**: Automatic history saving

### Development Features
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests with 100% coverage
- **Logging System**: Configurable logging 
- **Configuration Management**: Environment variable based setup
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and validation
